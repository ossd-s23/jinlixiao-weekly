Hello! My name is Jinli Xiao. I am an undegraduate student at the New York University, having a joint honors major in Computer Science and Mathematics. I am also an ex software engineer intern at Meta. My interests are distributed systems and data-intensive applications.

I am very willing to make new friends and learn new things! Please feel free to contact me.
