title: "Week 4: More on the Extension Project"
---

To me, contributing to open source has less to do with technical abilities.
Rather, it's more about adopting a particular mindset and workflow that enables
effective collaboration and collaborative problem solving.

## Our Open Source Mindset

Creating an open source project gives me the mindset that it can always be
improved. The design, code, and documentation that I have written all are deeply
influenced by the goals that these works should provide people who stumbled upon
them some takeaways if they are willing.

It could be that our product (the one-click pdf viewer) are useful to to them in
their work and studies. It could be that our comments give people more insight
or clarity in what and how we are trying to achieve. It could also be that the
code itself are extensible, maintainable, and easy to build upon.

I came up with the idea to optimize the Brightspace pdf viewing expeirence,
drawing upon my own (as well as my teammate's) frustrating experiences
navigating through its website. I also have heard the same complaint from lots
of friends, so I believe this project could benefit a lot of people.

We are also trying to prioritize on the communication part during the project.
Creating a browser extension is hard enough. Many different and significant
decisions have to be made within the same week. We need to keep everyone on the
same page.

We commited much effort in maintaining a meeting notes, containing all of our
decisions that we could easily refer to later. We held several meetings sharing
our ideas and make sure everyone is involved into the process. We also try to
make our livelog on Edstem as detailed as possible.

It is amazing to see that just with a week, we are all able to commit times on
our project significantly. It always feels good to see that everytime you run
`git fetch` there is some new things contributed by the others. ProgressÔºÅ

I once experienced a particularly satisfying moment of progress when, after
completing the implementation phase of a project, one of our group members
prepared a draft presentation. We collaborated to enhance the slides, each
proactively taking responsibility for a specific aspect such as language, style,
underlines, visuals, and more. In less than 10 minutes, we transformed the
presentation into what I believe to be a seemingly very professional one.

## Other Teams

It is also so great to see how fast my fellow classmates create those amazing
open source projects within a short timeframe. I have seen many great ideas and
great implementations that is tempting me to learn them more.

The Youtube Customizer is definitely a great project with great efforts. I
amazed to see how dedicated its members and how it explored a wide range of
extension interfaces into its project.

I also love the TabColor extension. The example that it provides looks very
charming and enticing to me.
