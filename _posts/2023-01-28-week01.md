title: "Week 1: Hello World"
---

I have always been thinking to increase my GitHub presence. It's hard for me not
to envious those people when they are labelling themselves as open source
citizens. Then I always find reasons to convince myself something else is more
important to do at the moment.

This is not the only case. From a long time ago (probably even before college),
I also wished to create a personal websites, write some blogs, and write cool
softwares with friends. I literally wrote those plans done a few times into my
sketchy to-do list, but due to some unfortunate intentional coincidences, those
plans are always postponed indefinitely.

I obviously didn't expect to be able to finish all of them in a single week, nor
did I expect them to be finished as part of an assignment. As if by some amazing
magic, I created my first website, wrote my first blog, organized my past GitHub
projects, and, as a reward, polished my resume. It is amazing to get things
done.

Lesson learned? Open source is great. Yes, none of the above is actually in the
formal definition of open source, but I have obviously benefited from the side
effect of taking a course in it, just in its first week. I am now more eager to
share ideas by reaching out, and open my mind by interacting with those amazing
people around me.

I would like to describe open source as this mindset of sharing and
collaborating through relatively geeky independent contributions, such as code
writing. It is based on the fundamental belief that people's ideas should be
free to share and use, allowing them to build upon each other's ideas to make
greater progress for human civilization, not just constantly reinventing the
wheel.

The word "source" in open source could mean anything, not just the source code.
So open source is more about openness: openness to ideas, openness to sharing,
and openness to collaboration. As opposed to closedness, openness of everything
could be bad for businesses that monetize on their private and confidential
ideas. But even in the software industry, where the source code is the most
valuable asset, there are already plenty of companies that have made their
projects open source, such as [Google](https://github.com/google),
[Meta](https://github.com/facebook), and
[Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft). Their business logic has already
integrated into this openness model, probably by marketing their technical
prowess and attracting talents to make their products more popular and better.

[Git](https://git-scm.com/), for example, is a great example of open source. It
revolutionized my thoughts on version control. I always find that it makes my
life easier, especially as I get more deeply involved with it.

I am also amazed by the fact that I am able to use
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for so many times dealing with myraids of
issues without actually knowing how it works, for free.

It's hard to imagine what lifes would be like without
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/). I am sure I would have to spend a lot of
time searching for information, and I would have to pay for it, which would
probably greatly discourage me from learning new things.

I am also really thankful for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which makes my
first attempt at creating a website so easy.

I praise such openness that results in the collaborative world we are living in,
that strikes the information barrier and allows ideas to pass in a more
efficient way, that provides us with some of the most powerful tools for free,
and that simply allows people to friendly and proudly shout out the most
inspirational phrase: "Hello World."
